# Simple WebGL Javascript demo

Id draws a simple cube, but it's a framework for isometric drawings and games!

This folder contains WebGL samples. If you want to run them, make sure you use Firefox, because Google Chrome has security locks that prevents read files in file:// mode. If you want, you can download a simple Web Server, like: Apache, Tomcat or NGix and serve the pages from it.
